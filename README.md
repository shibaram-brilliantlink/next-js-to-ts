# next-js-to-ts

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
It's part of my workshop series on converting a React app to TypeScript.

## Getting Started

First, install:

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn
```

Then, to run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Tests

Run in interactive watch mode:

```bash
npm run test -- -w
# or
yarn test -w
```
